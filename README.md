## Art and Architectural Argumentation Ontology Repository Description ##

<img src="/img/AAAo.svg" width="360"/>

This repository exists to provide a point of access for users to download the stable releases of the Art and Architectural Argumentation Ontology (AAAo). 

AAAo is built in reference to and extending the CIDOC CRM standard (https://www.cidoc-crm.org) and is designed to support the representation of historical data not easily represented using that standard. It introduces the key concepts of institutional fact and speech act in order to support the representation of socially grounded yet objective historical facts. For details of this modelling pattern and strategy please refer to the specification and surrounding documentation.

AAAo is the direct continuation of the ontology formerly known as CRM for Art and Architectural Argumentation (CRMaaa).

With the release of version 2.0 of the ontology the name has been changed to a) reflect its independent development from the modelling positions of the CIDOC CRM SIG and b) the fact that it stands a starting point for a new family of ontological models supporting historical documentation and reasoning questions. 

In addition to the name change, the ontology now has a new namespace and prefix.

* Namespace: https://ontology.swissartresearch.net/aaao/
* Prefix: aaao

The new namespace references the long term institutional home of the ontology, hosted by the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure. 

This repository is maintained through a collaboration between:

* the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en.html)
* Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)



AAAo is developed and maintained using the OntoMe tool. The project space for AAAo can be found here:

* https://ontome.net/project/69

Changes to the ontology are managed through that tool.

Discussions, suggestions and queries relative to the ontology should be raised using the issues feature of this repository.

In this repository users will find the different stable versions of AAAo which can be used for creating, managing and querying semantic data using the AAAo and its extensions. Each release includes at least a specification document in pdf format, explaining the ontology, and an rdfs file which enables its implementation as a semantic web ontology in rdfs supporting platforms and systems.

Tools

In addition to the ontology itself, we aim to provide different tools and documentation supporting the understanding and uptake of the ontology. 

Draw.io Library

Under the tools section of this repo, you will find a draw.io library to aid in formulating diagrams and proposal using the ontology. This library has been generated following the methods established for the CIDOC CRM and implemented by the Canadian Heritage Information Network (https://www.canada.ca/en/heritage-information-network.html). The creation of the draw.io library has been made possible with their support.


This is version 2.0.

To explore past versions, please find the 'stable' branches.

For releases under the CRMaaa name, please refer to the old repository: https://github.com/swiss-art-research-net/crmaaa
