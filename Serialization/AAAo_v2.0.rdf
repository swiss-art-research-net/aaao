  <!--
						This document represents the formal specification for an unofficial formal extension of the CIDOC CRM designed for application in the area of art and architectural historical research. The scope of this extension is to support art and architectural research in the sense of the study of primary and secondary documents for the derivation, manually and programmatically, of historically contextual facts that can be used to support reflection and structured argumentation. The core expressivity that this extension adds is the ability to accurately express historically bound, contextual social facts relative to the agents holding those beliefs and the temporal period for which those beliefs were valid. The extension enables this expressivity by introducing the notions of institutional fact and speech act as core modelling concepts. Institutional facts are collective beliefs about the world held by groups for a period of time. Such collective beliefs, while subjectively grounded, are epistemically objective for the community over which they hold sway. Introducing the notion of institutional fact allows for a specialization of the core CRM to be able to express these social realities (expressed in simple, aoristic binary properties in the core CRM) in their full social complexity as temporally and socially bound beliefs. The concomitant core notion introduced in this extension is the idea of Speech Act in the Austinian and Serlean sense. A speech act is a kind of intentional event (E7 Activity of CRM base) in which agents purposefully apply a rule and perform a set practice in order to bring about a new social state or institutional fact. Introducing the notion of speech act provides both a high-level ontological category and set of relations for describing the kinds of events which are the cause of institutional facts as well as providing a starting point for the analysis of the non-truth propositional use of information objects. In speech acts, information objects (e.g. phrases and formulae) are deployed not to convey states of the world but to generate states of the world. The subject of historical investigation is not simply the bare facts available to an empirical analysis of the physical world but involves an investigation of the social activities which generated contexts of understanding and belief that may differ significantly across times and peoples. Materializing the social facts implicit in CRM base as explicit institutional facts gives them a richer ontological representation and offers a consistent epistemological approach to their study by recognizing social, negotiated facts as objective realities in themselves and treating them as first order entities of study. This involves a departure from the aims of CRM base which is guided by an information integration functionality which favours the representation of the latest state of knowledge in a presentist perspective. In the study of the history of art and architecture it is in no small part the different non-coinciding facts held or supported by different actors over different times which are of interest. The materialization of institutional facts supports the information management functionality which guides this informal extension of the CIDOC CRM and which aims to support historians in representing the positive knowledge they can gather from primary and secondary sources of evidence of both past simple and institutional facts for the purposes of proposing hypotheses and analyses of texts, authors, periods, works and so on. In this regard, AAAo also provides an initial limited set of classes for describing traditional and digital methods of deriving facts from texts, in order to support the linking of contemporary research processes as provenance nodes for the different data points of simple and institutional facts which they generate in the course of their research.  Examples Used  With this in mind, examples have been chosen which potentially support a variety of social facts. Some of these facts, i.e., those held by one group of people at some time or other, may directly contradict another, i.e., that held by a different group of people at some potentially different time. Most of the examples have been reused across different types of social fact, in order to tell more completely the history of the objects in question and the beliefs that have been held about them by specific groups of people over a given period of time. These histories can in themselves be quite complex. References are thus provided for further contextualization. These appear in brackets following the examples, like so:    The Ownership Status (ZE8) of theGʼpsgolox totem pole (E22) as 'has current owner' theHaisla people (E74) from 1872 - 2012 holds for theHaisla people (E74) and as 'has current owner' the Swedish National Museum of Ethnography (E74) from 1929 - 2006 holds for the Swedish Polity. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CA%BCpsgolox_totem_pole)    Compatibility and Nomenclature  This unofficial extension of the CIDOC CRM is formulated in relation to the following official extensions:    CIDOC CRM v.7.1.3  CIDOC CRM Dig v.4.0  CRMtex v.1.0  LRM v.1.0    The specification consists of a set of declarations for formalized classes and properties that extend the CIDOC CRM and the above official extensions.  Adopting the conventions of the CIDOC CRM each class and property have been given an identifier in addition to their names. The naming convention adopted for this extension is:  ZE = class  ZP = property  The choice of these names was arbitrary, making a conceptual connection with the official CRM representation while clearly distinguishing the new classes and properties from those of either CRM base or its official extensions.  Namespace  https://ontology.swissartresearch.net/aaao    Maintenance and Archiving  AAAo is an actively maintained ontology. It is our aim to develop publicly and participatively, learning from and engaging with the scholarly community that adopts it. Towards this end we maintain the ontology with the following processes and relative tools.  Ontology Development  We adopt the OntoMe tool developed byLARHRAto manage the ontology and produce editions. This ensures a consistent management of the ontology and provides a public space to engage in revisions.  The maintenance space for the ontology can be found here:https://ontome.net/project/69  Please note, at time of publishing, OntoME is not capable of producing complete, provenanced RDF serializations, so please only use the official RDF for this standard stored on our github. See below.  Issue Management and Revision Storage  We adopt github as a platform for inviting and managing issues related to the ontology as well as providing an active place to be able to access the latest edition of the ontology, its specification and relevant documentation.  The address for the github repository is:https://github.com/swiss-art-research-net/aaao  Acknowledgements  The initiative for creating, developing and maintaining this ontology is made possible by important on-going funding and institutional commitment, which is gratefully acknowledged here.  Funding Support    The development of the initial version (v0.9) of AAAo was initiated and generously funded by ETH Zurich, Chair of the History and Theory of Architecture, Prof. Maarten Delbeke.  The continuted development and enrichment of the latest version (v1.5) has been generously funded as part of the Open Research Data (ORD) initiative by swissuniversities.    Collaborations  Collaborations with the following projects provided important feedback and input for the testing and further elaboration of the standard:  The initial modelling around this extension have been supported by collaboration with:    theReleven: Re-evaluating the Eleventh Centuryproject  theGlobaliseproject    Institutional Support  The continuous maintenance and promotion of AAAo is made possible by the initial commitment of its partners to maintain the ontology and promote its understanding and adoption.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An instance of institutional fact is an ascription of a status function to an object by a community. The institutional fact is a concretization of a collective intentionality of the community in question towards a certain object over a certain period of time.
An instance of institutional fact is recognizable to a competent speaker/member of a symbolic community (native or learner with sufficient competence). It may not be perceived through a single sense impression but through multiple experiences and implicit reasonings (e.g.: embedded participation, behavioural observation, linguistic evidence and interview), yet typically such intermediate observations and inferences are not necessarily recorded or accessible. The historical statement is typically the assertion of the institutional fact, that such and such a fact was the case, and was in force for a given community, at some time. The epistemic veridicality of the stated /reference instance of institutional fact is always open to contestation. The means of contestation involve analyzing the sources which support it.
Instances of institutional fact come into existence based on conventions establishing the conditions under which they come into effect. Typically, an instance of institutional fact will come into existence either because of the performance of its stipulated, initiating speech act (e.g.: state of being married via marriage) or as a result of events fulfilling existing norm prescriptions in the community (e.g.: state of being uncle as result of birth of child of sister). An institutional fact comes to be through the agreed fiat of a community. It typically ceases to exist either because of a stipulated, nullifying speech act (e.g. divorce proceeding), because a community ceases to support the effective rule supporting its declaration (e.g.: ownership of people) or force majeure (e.g.: object ascribed function/status or community perceiving status is eliminated).</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An instance of social status is the collective ascription of a social function to an actor by a community. The substance of the social status is the communal commitment to relating to and acting toward the actor in question according to the designated status.
It is important to underline that an instance of social status relates to a classification of an individual as holding a particular role or function in the community in general. This is to be distinguished from a social relation status, a binary construct that binds two different actors in a certain relation. For example, an instance of social status could be the social status of "Coach". This social status, if ascribed to an individual, holds for that person within a general social context and for a particular group and/or population. This is distinct from a social relation status that is recognized particularly between the two individuals concerned, such as "coach of", that would particularly hold between the individual who is coach and the individual who is a team member.
Instances of social status are recognizable through evidence of community members adopting the intentional stance of so relating or acting toward the actor in question, as observable from direct witnesses, through the reports of competent observers or through evidence of a declarative act [e.g.: E17 Type Assignment] initiating this status.
Instances of social status may be attributed to individuals or to groups of individuals. Instances of social status may also be held in relation to a third party, to whom the subject of the social status bears certain rights and/or responsibilities.
Instances of social status may come to be through a formal process such as a declarative act of assignment [E17 Type Assignment], or may have arisen through habit, fiat or be of unknown origin. Instances of social status may end either though a formal process, such as a new declarative act of classification, or may simply fade out of use, be eliminated by fiat or by unknown reason.</rdfs:comment>

In the context of semantic data processes, such output might consist in semantically encoded knowledge graph statements, the collection of which may be referred to as an I4 Propositional Set, which can be regarded as the 'conclusion' of the digital reading. As such, Digital reading may be regarded as a computational process guided by a parametrized hypothesis resulting in a new propositional dataset for scientific consideration. The propositional information generated by the digital reading process should be considered as provisional knowledge posited under a hypothesis. Typically propositions generated by the digital reading may become the subject of further scholarly research.
Instances of this class come to be when a process is initiated to generate new information and finish upon completion of that process or if the process is interrupted and fails to complete.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An instance of critical reading is a process of analysis undertaken by a scholar to derive analytical facts from a specific information resource. Critical reading engages the background knowledge of the scholar and their interpretive horizon in order to support them in actively reading the research object to derive factual, historically contextualized/contextualizing information regarding the propositional content in question and the world(s) it pertains too. This process can take as input previous scholarly documentation or outputs of digital reading events. Critical reading may result in a series of constructed arguments, serving as a foundation for the documentation and analysis of an argument regarding the text and its referents. Critical reading might also result in the observation, documentation or assertion of a social fact, such as the assertion of an appellative or classificatory status. In the latter case, the instance of ZE18 Critical Reading serves as provenance for the existence of the fact in the network.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of physical locative status are recognizable through evidence of community members adopting the intentional stance of so recognizing this status, as observable from direct witnesses, through the reports of competent observers or through evidence of a declarative act initiating this status.
Instances of locative status may come to be through a formal process such as a declarative act of such definition, or may have arisen through habit, fiat or be of unknown origin. Instances of locative status may end either though a formal process, such as a new declarative act, or may simply fade out of use, be eliminated by fiat or be of unknown reason.</rdfs:comment>

The substance of the topographical status is the communal attribution of a defined spatial association between two geographic places.
As opposed to connections created between geographic places as determine through a pure mathematic relation, e.g.: the falling within of a larger geometry by a smaller geometry, topographical statuses depend also on a de jure, socially recognized connection between two topographies. For example, when there are distinct political positions on the boundaries of a country, whether a geographic area 'falls within' another geographic area depends not only on the geometric calculation, but on the definition of extents of the geographic spaces in the first place.

The substance of the promissory status is the communal recognition of the promise in question, which may nonetheless only bind two individuals directly. The substance of promissory status includes the ascription of an outcome which may detail guidelines and constraints that downstream activities on the part of promissory parties should comply with. Put otherwise, the promise promises a futural event on the part of the promisor to the promisee. The specified promissory constraints of this event can be instantiated on the level of kinds of processes, items or qualities and quantities involved in the action.
Instances of promissory status are recognizable through evidence of community members adopting an intentional stance towards the promise that exists between the two parties, as observable from direct witnesses, through the reports of competent observers or through documentary evidence of a declarative act (e.g.: ZE46 Promissory Agreement Event) initiating this status.
Instances of promissory status may come to be through a formal process such as a declarative promisory agreement, or may have arisen through habit, fiat or be of unknown origin.

Instances of this class comprise explicit acts undertaken following given procedures within a social grouping leading to explicit recognition of a promissory status between two actors. The substance of promissory agreement is an intentional, social act.
Instances of ZE46 Promissory Agreement come about when the specific social procedure required is intentionally and successfully enacted according to the prevalent rules. They end with the successful termination of the act or because of its premature termination.
A successful act of ZE46 Promissory Agreement leads to the generation of an instance of ZE45 Promissory Status, the institutional fact that thereafter holds between two actors until it has been abrogated.</rdfs:comment>

The substance of the text sequence status is the communal attribution of a recognizable sequencing order between the designated text fields
As opposed to the connections created between a text field and the physical substrate upon which it is written, text sequence statuses are created de jure rather than de facto and create socially recognized connections between them. For example, an editorial annotation may indicate that a paragraph from a 'lower' position on the writing surface (such as a page) is to be inserted between two paragraphs at a 'higher' position (or on another page altogether). In such cases, the sequence in which the paragraphs are to be read does not coincide with the physical position of the text field in question, or the exact ordering of the paragraphs may be the subject of research or scholarly debate, but we do have de jure attribution from which some knowledge may be derived and documented with an instance of Text Sequence Status.

It is important to underline that an instance of social relation consists of is a binary construct that binds two different actors in a certain relation and is to be distinguished from social status. For example, an instance of social relation status could be the social relation status of "professor of" between a teacher and their student. This is a social relation status that is recognized particularly between the two individuals concerned, to be distinguished from a social status, recognized, for example, by the title 'Dr', which may or may not be held at the time in question and has no particular bearing on a relationship with any one individual.

At a general level, the performance plan is what is appealed to in order to carry out the symbolic act in the first place. For example, an act of defiance may call on a specific sequence of gestures to be instantiated.
The case of speech act (ZE13) is a special case of symbolic act where the performance plan indicates the series of necessary procedures that must be followed in order for the speech act to have been successfully carried out and to have created a genuine instance of the institutional fact that it was designed to make possible.</rdfs:comment>

This property is used to connect the instance of event to the instance of institutional fact which it brought into existence by fiat thanks to its accordance to a socially defined norm. In this case the bringing about of a new institutional fact need not be intentional or following any particular rule intentionally. Rather, within a social context it is recognized that the very fact of a particular event occurring is causal to the initiation of the related social fact. For example, in certain property right laws, the very fact of writing down an idea (E65 Creation) initiates an instance of property right over the generated information object, regardless of the intention or not of the author to so create such a right.</rdfs:comment>
